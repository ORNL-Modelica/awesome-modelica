Modelica is a non-proprietary, object-oriented, equation based modeling language to conveniently model complex physical systems containing, e.g., mechanical, electrical, electronic, hydraulic, thermal, control, electric power or process-oriented subcomponents.

See the [official Modelica website](https://www.modelica.org/) for the official specification and more information about the Modelica Language.
